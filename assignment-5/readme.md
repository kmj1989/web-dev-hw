However, I suffered difficulty about inserting soundtrack. The site that instructor recommended was very unfamiliar for me and I don't know how to use it. Although I searched my song, _Something Just Like This_, and I inserted the link. However, my live site couldn't show that one. I don't know what problem is in this process.

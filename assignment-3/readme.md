*  **How many ```<head>``` and ```<body>``` elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?**

There is only one head and one body in a page. Through ```<head>```, I can decide the style, meta, title, and so on. Then, in ```<body>```, I can include whole contents with markups. 

* **Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.**

Semantic markup is the code that I can order when I make html. For example, if I want to emphasize for a word, I can use semantic markup such as ```<strong>```. On the other hand, structural markup is the code that help to divide the structure easily. I can divide heading, body, footer easily by using structural markup such as ```<body>```, ```<p>```, and so on.  

* **Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.**

The instructions and example are really detailed for this assignment. Because of this, I could understand very well and complete easily more than I thought. First, I saved beetcake-glaze.html, beetcake-garnish.html, and provided image in my assignment 3 folder. Then, I saw the example and instructions continuously and complete my index.html in a calm and orderly way. Finally, after I linked the provided html, I modified them with the instructions. Also, I tested mine by opening with browsers. Then, I uploaded through github.

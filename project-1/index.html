      <pre>Lonely reivers flow To the sea to the sea
To the open arms of the sea.
Lonely rivers sigh Wait for me wait for me.
I'll be coming home.
Wait for me.<br />

Oh,my love my darling.
I've hungered for your touch.
A long lonely time.<br />

And time goes by so slowy.
Ant time can do so much.
Are you still mine.<br />

I need your love.
I need your love.
God speed your love to me.<br />

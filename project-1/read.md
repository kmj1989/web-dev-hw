#### Browsers:
  * Internet Explorer
  * Safari (for mobile)

Both browsers show the sites that I used well. I could see the sites and my HTML comfortably.
The explorer show my HTML directly from my folder.
Especially, when I searched with mobile, the sites were shown suitably with my mobile screen.

#### Wayback Machine:

It is very interesting for me and I could remind my childhood and memory.
In my country (South Korea), "Naver" is very popular site. Thus, I searched _www.naver.com_ on Wayback Machine.
I could see _naver.com_ of 2000. It looked very different from now. It looked really smaller than now.
Then, there were a lot of letters more than pictures. Also, overall width of the site was too small. The design was older and simpler than now.

#### Work Cycle:

Making my website was really simple. I could find my song easily and insert easily. Also, codes such as ```<p>, <br />``` were interesting. I could complete easily, but I felt confusion about inserting image. Sometimes I needed to modified because of image. Generally, my work was successful.
